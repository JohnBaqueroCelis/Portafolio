        My name is <strong>John</strong>, I&apos;m a software engineer and
        I&apos;m located in MonterÃ­a City, here in Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´. My favorite
        language is <strong>Javascript</strong>, I&apos;ve learned a lot of
        things using it and it&apos;s my current tool which I&apos;m working on.
        My goal is to use it as a tool for creating great technologic solutions
        tailored to the companies needed. I trust that teamwork is the best way
        to advance and get better results in any company and project.
